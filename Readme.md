# A PHP Micro Framework
An adaptation of a small framework which I originally created for projects in 2007. Designed to provide a foundation that was simplified web projects by making them easy to learn, deploy, and update. Was used at a prior employer to enable junior staff with little to no training in web development the ability to quickly produce working web-based applications. 
I would not recommend the usage of this beyond "quick and dirty" prototypes or learning. This does not support many of the features required in a modern enterprise application. This is more an exercise in how frameworks work and how structured structured could be used to create a MVC web framework. It is also a used to test newer features in php 8.x (original framework was written in php 4/5). 
## Project Conventions
- PSR-12: Extended Coding Style (https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)
### File Extensions
+ .php = php executable or include file.
+ .phtml = php template file - contains both html and php content.
### General Rules
- lowercase throughout.
- snake case for functions, variables, and namespaces.
- kebab case for path components, array labels, and form input labels (example: site-users/user-assignment.json).
### Functions
- pirogue\\_library_init() = library initialize function.
- pirogue\\_library_dispose() = internal function, library destructor function registered when library is initialized.
- pirogue\\library_function() = public function within a library (example: dispatcher_redirect()).
- pirogue\\_library_function() = internal function, used within dispatcher and library only(example: _dispatcher_send()). 
### Variables
#### Global Variables
Variables registered with a global array ($GLOBALS or $_SESSION) are prefixed with the '.' character to prevent them from being exported to the current symbol table (via register_globals or extract()).
- $GLOBALS['.\_pirogue.library.var-name'] = internal variable (prefixed with '.\_').
- $GLOBALS['.pirogue.library.var-name'] = public variable (prefixed with '.').
#### Local Variables
- $\_varaible_name =  interal variable that is scoped to current scope only.
- $varaible_name = public variable - can be used outside of scope.
### Path 
Any parts of a path that are prefixed with a '_' character are considered "protected" and are not directly accessabile to the client (can not be routed by HTTP requests). The dispatcher is repsonsible for removing these special character prefixes. 
- public/public.phtml = public file, inaccessible by client directly.
- _private/end-point.phtml = internal file, inaccessible by client directly.
- public/_private.phtml = internal file, inaccessible by client directly.
## Controllers
Controllers are stored in a controller directory and are loaded when needed. Each controller should implement the following functions:
- "{$controller namespace}\\_{controller}_init():void"
- "{$controller namespace}\\_{controller}_dispose():void" 
- "{$controller namespace}\\{controller}_has_access():bool"
- "{$controller namespace}\\{controller}_error_404():array" - optional, intercepts and handles HTTP 404 errors from default controller.
- "{$controller namespace}\\{controller}_{$action}_{$request method}():array" - action invoked in controller. For example, if the user requests account/index.html then this request would mapp to the account\\index_get() function.
## Views
Views are stored in a view directory and are loaded by the controller's action function.
## Example project layout
The following defines the directory structure for a trival example site that allows users to log in, view account information and update their information.
```
/include
  -- pirogue/
  -- website/
/config
  -- mysqli-website.ini
/controller
  -- _default.php
  -- account.php
  -- session.php
/htdocs
  -- css/
  -- script/
  -- fonts/
  -- _dispatcher.php
/view
  -- _page.phtml
  -- account-index.phtml
  -- account-update-password.phtml
  -- account-update-info.phtml
  -- index.phtml
  -- login-form.phtml

```
